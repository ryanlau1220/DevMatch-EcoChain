# EcoChain - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview

EcoChain is a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) network for verifiable environmental data, using simulated sensor data for the initial implementation. The project integrates multiple blockchain technologies to create a comprehensive environmental monitoring solution.

### Tracks Integrated
- **Sui (Core Platform)**: Object-centric model for managing virtual sensors as NFTs
- **Oasis Protocol (Trust Layer)**: Confidential smart contract execution and ROFL for off-chain computation
- **Blockchain for Good Alliance**: Addresses UN SDGs 11 and 13
- **The Graph**: Track 1 - Data accessibility through Subgraph indexing
- **Ethereum Foundation**: Track 3 - Best Tooling for Prediction Markets Built on Ethereum for environmental prediction markets
- **ChatAndBuild**: AI-powered application development platform for rapid prototyping and deployment
